## Prerequisites

We recommend work on Linux, because it is easier install packages and frameworks; but, if you want to work on Windows you can do it.

### Python
You must have installed python3 on your pc, so check it.

```shell
$ python3 --version
Python 3.5.2
```

If you haven't python installed you can install it with the command below

```shell
$ sudo apt install python3
```

### Node (npm)

Furthermore you must have `node.js` on your computer, you can download it from their [Webpage](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), or just run the following command if you are in a Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distribution

```shell
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

When you have installed `node.js` you can check your version

```shell
$ node --version
v8.9.4

$ npm --version
5.6.0
```

When you have installed `node.js` with `npm`, install `gulp` and `yarn`

```shell
$ sudo npm install -g gulp
$ curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn
```

After install the packages, check it in your system
```shell
$ gulp --version
CLI version 3.9.1

$ yarn --version
1.3.2
```

> If you have any problem installing the packages, visit the [Node webpage](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), or [Yarn webpage](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

## Installation
### Clone the repository

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/CapituloJaverianoACM/ACMWebSite.git
$ cd ACMWebSite
```

### Create a virtual environment (This step is optional)

If you don't want to install the project's requirements on your computer, we are going to create a virtual environment to install them there.

#### Creating the virtual environment

We gonna use `myvenv` as the name of the virtual environment, but you can use the name that you prefer.

```shell
$ python3 -m venv myvenv
```

#### Activating the virtual environment

```shell
$ source myvenv/bin/activate
```

> After activate your virtual environment your command line prompt should look like this

```shell
(myvenv) $
```

> If you want to exit from your virtual environment just run the command `deactivate` on the console

### Install the requirements

Install the python packages described in the `requirements.txt`, and node packages described in the `package.json`

```shell
$ npm run requirements
$ yarn --prod=false
```

### Migrate the database

```shell
$ python manage.py migrate
```

## Deployment

### 1. Build the project

```shell
$ npm run build
```

### 2. Running django server

```shell
$ npm start
```

> After starting your local server you can test the webpage on [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

## Gulp tasks

This tasks are described in the `gulpfile.babel.js` file, and can help you to work with the project

To run the development mode just run the following command, it start the `default` gulp task.

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

Furthermore there are another task that you can execute them with the command below

```shell
$ gulp <taskname>
```
